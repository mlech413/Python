# Python Data Analysis
## PyBank Financial Analysis
### Contains a Python script that analyzes a financial record dataset, and creates a terminal output along with an output file.
The Python script "main.py" reads in the csv file "budget_data.csv" in the Resources folder, containing month-year and the profit/loss amounts. It analyzes the records and calculates each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The script outputs to the terminal, and also writes out file "financial_analysis.txt" in the analysis folder.
